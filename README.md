# Memory game

A small memory app written with React.

User can select the size of the game and the type of card (colors or pictures)
and play a memory game. The game can be restarted with or without shuffling.

Pictures are taken from https://picsum.photos/

### Ideas of improvement

Using more time, we could:
* add tests to the app,
* add a loading component while the images load,
* enhance design,
* add animations,
* add a bot
